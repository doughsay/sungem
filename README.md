Sungem
======

What is it?
-----------

Sungem is a small, lightweight, and fast web application framework.
It's meant to provide a solid foundation for developing whatever
you want, without restricting you too much.  It's loosely based on
the MVC pattern, and is mostly written in the functional style.

More documentation coming soon!
